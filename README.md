# Saffe API

The purpose of this repository is to be the central reference on using the Saffe API, with the ultimate goal of providing customers with pointers to SDKs and comprehensive documentation.

Currently, its content is only of interest to selected partners given that our sandbox is being made available on an invitation basis.

If you landed here having received your Saffe `API_USER` and `API_KEY` for testing purposes, please proceed to our [Wiki](https://github.com/saffe/saffe-api/wiki).
